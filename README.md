# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code Solutions
These are my Advent of Code submissions. Each file is a revisited solution, written sometime after I've had time to revisit each problem.

# Tools

To run my solutions, I aliased custom `aoc` and `aot` commands, which run the first Python file found in the current working directory with both test and real input. This works by piping `< in` and `< test` into the `python3` command, which allows you to use `open(0).read()` to access the file.
<br>

Changes to `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
alias aoc='echo -n "$(tput setaf 6)" && python3 "$(fd -e py | head -n 1)" < test && echo -n  "$(tput sgr0)" && python3 "$(fd -e py | head -n 1)" < in'
alias aot='python3 "$(fd -e py | head -n 1)" < test'
```

| Command     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `aoc`       | Run the first Python program found in the current working directory with the test input and real input. The output of the programming running on test input is output in cyan.       |
| `aot`       | Only runs the first Python program found on the test input.        |

Additionally, I use a [custom userscript](/host/userscript.js) for copying code blocks, which is a modified version of [tjjfvi's custom userscript](https://github.com/tjjfvi/aoc-2021/blob/main/host/userscript.js).
